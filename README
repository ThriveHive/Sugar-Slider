# How to Use it

### Use the shortcode:

`[sugar_slider]`

### Specify the attachment ids for the images you want to include: 

`[sugar_slider ids="9,14,25,26,27,28,29,30"]`

### You can find the attachment id for an image on the image's media page

In the url for the image you'll see a number after the text `attachment_id=`

E.g. http://www.yourwebsite.com/?attachment_id=34

In this case it would be `34`
